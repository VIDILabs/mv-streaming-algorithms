# Algorithms for Multivariate Streaming Data Analysis

About
-----
* Algorithms for multivariate streaming data analysis. We originally developed these algorithms for : ***A Visual Analytics Framework for Reviewing Streaming Performance Data***.
Suraj P. Kesavan, Takanori Fujiwara, Jianping Kelvin Li, Caitlin Ross, Misbah Mubarak, Christopher D. Carothers, Robert B. Ross, and Kwan-Liu Ma. In Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis), forthcoming

* Demonstration of a system using the algorithms: https://youtu.be/pxthZSJ1jqs

* Features
  * Online and progressive algorithms for multivariate streaming data analysis. These algorithms can provide results with required latency.
    1. Incremental PCA-based online change point detection with adaptive forgetting factor.
    2. Progressive PCA using incremental mechanism with consideration of visual consistency.
    3. Progressive k-means clustering with with consideration of visual consistency.
    4. Progressive causality analysis methods
